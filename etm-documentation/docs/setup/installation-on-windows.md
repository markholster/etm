# Installation on Windows
Although Enterprise Telemetry Monitor best performs on linux like systems it can be run under windows as well. You can download Enterprise Telemetry Monitor from [https://www.jecstar.com/assets/downloads/etm/etm-4.3.0.zip](https://www.jecstar.com/assets/downloads/etm/etm-4.3.0.zip) and unzip it with your favorite archiving tool. 

In the directory <UNZIP_LOCATION>\etm-4.3.0\bin you will find a file named *etm.bat*. By executing that batch file Enterprise Telemetry Monitor will start.
