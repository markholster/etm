# Search template widget
On the top right of the search screen you see your search templates. By default three most common templates are provided for you, but of course you can change or delete them as you like. To create an search template just fill in a query in the [Search widget](search-widget.md) enter a template name and hit the *Save* button. If a template with exactly the same name already exist you will see a warning message which asks you to confirm the overwrite of an existing template. All settings regarding the query, like results per page, result columns etc will be stored in your search template.

To use a search template just click on the name in the Search template widget. All setting stored with the search template will be restored to your current search context. 

To delete a search template click on the red cross behind the name and confirm the deletion of the template. If you accidentally 
removed the wrong template just hit the *Save* button again and the search template will be available again. Note that if you 
changed anything in the search context between the removal and the save of the search template that will be saved as well. Search
templates can be re-arranged by dragging them into the desired position.

Your Enterprise Telemetry Monitor administrator may set a limit on the number of templates that you can store. If the limit is reached a message will be shown in the Search template widget.
