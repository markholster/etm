# Upgrades
Enterprise Telemetry Monitor is maintaining a semantic versioning strategy. Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

* MAJOR version when Enterprise Telemetry Monitor contains incompatible API changes,
* MINOR version when Enterprise Telemetry Monitor adds functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
* PATCH version when Enterprise Telemetry Monitor makes backwards-compatible bug fixes.

Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.

## Upgrades within the same MAJOR version.

1. Make sure you have a backup of all Elasticsearch data!
1. Download and uncompress the required Elasticsearch version to a new directory. See the [Support matrix](../support-matrix/README.md) for the version you should run.
1. Stop all Enterprise Telemetry Monitor nodes.
1. Stop your current Elasticsearch nodes.
1. Merge changes from the`config/elasticsearch.yml`,  `config/jvm.options` and `config/log4j2.properties` files in your current Elasticsearch nodes to your new ones. Note that merging is only recommended when you have made changes to those files. When you've not changed anything in those files it is recommended to leave them untouched in your new Elasticsearch installation.
1. If your Elasticsearch data resides in the same directory as your Elasticsearch installation make sure you copy the data to the new Elasticsearch installation.
1. Start your new Elasticsearch nodes and wait for the message ```Cluster health status changed from [RED] to [GREEN]``` to appear.
1. Download and uncompress Enterprise Telemetry Monitor to a new directory.
1. Copy all files under `lib/ext/` from your old Enterprise Telemetry Monitor installation to the new one.
1. Copy the `config/etm.yml` & `config/jvm.options` files from your old Enterprise Telemetry Monitor installation to the new one. Note that older versions of Enterprise Telemetry Monitor might not have a 'config/jvm.options' file.
1. Check if any of the [Version specific changes](#version-specific-changes) applies to your situation.
1. Start your Enterprise Telemetry Monitor nodes.

## Upgrade from version 3.5.x to 4.x
1. Your data will be converted during the upgrade so as always make sure you have a backup of all Elasticsearch data!
1. Make sure you have a non-ldap (local) admin account! Enterprise Telemetry Monitor requires the import of server certificates starting with release 4.x so you wont be able to login using an LDAP account configured on an LDAP server connected over TLS.
1. Make sure you have received a new license. Older licenses are not compatible with the license required by Enterprise Telemetry Monitor 4 and higher.
1. Enterprise Telemetry Monitor requires Java 11. Download and install Java 11 when necessary.
1. Download and uncompress Elasticsearch 7.x to a new directory.
1. Stop all Enterprise Telemetry Monitor nodes.
1. Stop your current Elasticsearch nodes.
1. Merge changes from the `config/elasticsearch.yml`, `config/jvm.options` and `config/log4j2.properties` files in your current Elasticsearch nodes to your new ones. Note that merging is only recommended when you have made changes to those files. When you've not changed anything in those files it is recommended to leave them untouched in your new Elasticsearch installation.
1. If your Elasticsearch data resides in the same directory as your Elasticsearch installation make sure you copy the data to the new Elasticsearch installation.
1. Start your new Elasticsearch nodes and wait for the message ```Cluster health status changed from [RED] to [GREEN]``` to appear.
1. Download and uncompress Enterprise Telemetry Monitor 4.x to a new directory.
1. Copy all files under `lib/ext/` from your old Enterprise Telemetry Monitor installation to the new one.
1. Copy the `config/etm.yml` & `config/jvm.options` files from your old Enterprise Telemetry Monitor installation to the new one.
1. Disable all processors in the etm.yml. This will prevent events to be processed when your new license isn't entered yet.
1. Start a single Enterprise Telemetry Monitor node in console mode and wait for the data migration to complete. Login to Enterprise Telemetry Monitor and validate the migration.
1. [Import](../administrating/license-registration.md) your new license.
1. [Import](../administrating/cluster.md#certificate-settings) your LDAP and/or SMTP certificates used to setup a secure connection.
1. Validate everything is working fine. Stop the running Enterprise Telemetry Monitor node.  
1. Enable all required processors when disabled in a previous step and restart the node.
1. Start all Enterprise Telemetry Monitor nodes.

## Version specific changes
Sometimes your Enterprise Telemetry Monitor configuration needs additional changes before it can be upgraded. This section describes these changes necessary before upgrading.

### Upgrade from versions before 3.5.0 to 3.5.x or higher
1. Remove the option `restProcessorLoginRequired` in the http chapter in the file `config/etm.yml`. This option is replaced by the api key functionality.

### Upgrade from versions before 3.4.0 to 3.4.x or higher
1. Change the `connectAddresses` in the elasticsearch chapter from the Elasticsearch transport address to the Elasticsearch http address.
1. Remove the options `sslEnabled`, `sslKeyLocation`, `sslCertificateLocation` & `sslCertificateAuthoritiesLocation` in the elasticsearch chapter in the file `config/etm.yml`. These options are replaced by `sslTrustStoreLocation` and `sslTrustStorePassword` which can hold a jks key store.
